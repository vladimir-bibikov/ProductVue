## Code Overview

The project consists of the following files:

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the Vue.js application.
* `main.js`: The main JavaScript file that defines the Vue.js application.
* `ProductCard.vue`: A Vue.js component that represents a single product card.
* `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.

### `index.html`

The `index.html` file is the main HTML file that includes the Vue.js application. It contains the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Vue.js Product Listing</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `<div id="app"></div>` element is where the Vue.js application will be mounted.

### `main.js`

The `main.js` file is the main JavaScript file that defines the Vue.js application. It contains the following code:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import ProductCard from './components/ProductCard.vue';

export default new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  components: {
